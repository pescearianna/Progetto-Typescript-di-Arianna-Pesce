## Description  

Typescript Project by Arianna Pesce | Front-End Development | start2impact University

Visit the code in **PenCode**: [https://codepen.io/pescearianna/pen/WbNjJbB](https://codepen.io/pescearianna/pen/WbNjJbB)

This project aims to develop a TypeScript-based system that models the operational structure of a beachwear brand using recycled plastic, focusing on the interactions between customers, beachwear products, and sustainable production processes.
Through the definition of interfaces and classes representing the various components of the system (IProduct, IClient, IProcessProduction), the project demonstrates how technology can support sustainable innovation in the fashion industry.

---  

## Instruction to understand the project 

1. I've created 3 interfaces: IProduct, IClient, IProcessProduction.
2. For each interface I've created 3 class: Product, Client, ProcessProduction
3. Each class has a particular method. You can see the results in the Console. 
4. Methods explained: in the Product class, the assignCustomer method will associate the product with a specific customer, marking it as "ordered"; in the Customer class, the orderProduct method will allow the customer to order an available product; in the ProductionProcess class, the addProduct method will enable the addition of new items to the production process, increasing the supply of sustainable products.

   In the folder 'src' you can find the file.ts, in the foldeer dist you can find the file already transpilled.
   This is a project developed with CodePen, the HTML&CSS code is only decorative, you MUST eliminate if you don't have intention to use it, on the other hand you MUST connect the file each others.

3.**Configuration Typescript**:
 You needs to have installed Node.js in your computer. 
 
 Then in your terminal, open the folder and write: npm install -g typescript
 
 To compile the file in your computer: tsc namefile.ts
